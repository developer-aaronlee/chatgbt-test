"""chatgpt temperature"""
# The temperature parameter controls the randomness of the generated text, with higher values leading to more diverse
# and unpredictable output.
#
# A good starting point for temperature when generating code with ChatGPT is around 0.5-0.7. This value strikes
# a balance between generating diverse and creative output while also maintaining syntactical and logical coherence.
